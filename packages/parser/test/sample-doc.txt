Getting Started with Our API

First, you need to install our SDK. Open your terminal and run:
npm install @company/sdk

Once installed, import the client into your JavaScript file:
import { Client } from '@company/sdk'

Next, create a client instance with your API key. You can get your API key from the dashboard:
const client = new Client({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
})

Now you're ready to make your first request. Let's fetch a list of users:
const response = await client.users.list({ limit: 10 })
console.log(response.data)

That's it! You've made your first API call.
